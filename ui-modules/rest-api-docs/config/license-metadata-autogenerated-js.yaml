  license_text: "# Angular Multiple Transclusion\n\n## A concise way to use multiple `ng-transclude` directives within the same AngularJs template.\n\nAngular Multiple Transclusion extends `ng-transclude` to add support for multiple transclusion.\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n  <div class=\"panel-heading\" ng-transclude transclude-from=\"header\">\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"panel-body\" ng-transclude transclude-from=\"content\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Demo\n\nhttp://codepen.io/mcasimir/pen/XbapYd\n\n## Install\n\n```\nbower i --save angular-multiple-transclusion\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n**Example task:** Create a `myPanel` directive transcluding a fragment to the header and a fragment to the body.\n\nUse `transclude-from` attribute along with `ng-transclude` directive to define insertion points for transclusion:\n\n``` js\nangular.module('myApp', ['angular-multiple-transclusion'])\n\n.directive('myPanel', function(){\n  return {\n    restrict: 'E',\n    transclude: true,\n    template:\n      '<div class=\"panel panel-default\">' +\n      '    <div class=\"panel-heading\" ng-transclude transclude-from=\"header\">' +\n      '    </div>' +\n      '    <div class=\"panel-body\" ng-transclude transclude-from=\"content\">' +\n      '    </div>' +\n      '</div>'\n  };\n});\n```\n\nUse `transclude-to` to wire each element to the respective `ng-transclude` block:\n\n``` html\n<main ng-app=\"myApp\">\n  <my-panel>\n    <div transclude-to=\"header\">Hi there!</div>\n    <div transclude-to=\"content\">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</div>\n  </my-panel>\n</main>\n```\n\n## Works with isolated scopes\n\n``` js\n.directive('myDialog', function(){\n  return {\n    restrict: 'E',\n    scope: {\n      title: '@'\n    },\n    transclude: true,\n    template:\n      '<div class=\"dialog\">' +\n      '    <div class=\"dialog-title\">{{title}}</div>' +\n      '    <div class=\"dialog-body\" ng-transclude transclude-from=\"content\">' +\n      '    </div>' +\n      '    <div class=\"dialog-actions\" ng-transclude transclude-from=\"actions\">' +\n      '    </div>' +\n      '</div>'\n  };\n});\n```\n\n``` html\n<main ng-app=\"myApp\" ng-init=\"title='My Document'\">\n  <my-dialog title=\"Save Document\">\n    <div transclude-to=\"body\">Are you sure?</div>\n    <div transclude-to=\"actions\">\n      <button>Save {{title}}</button>\n    </div>\n  </my-dialog>\n</main>\n```\n\n## Why multiple transclusion rocks?\n\nSee how people at [OpenTable](http://www.opentable.com) uses multiple transclusion with angular to create reusable components:\n\n- https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/creating-container-components-part-2-angular-1-directives"

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n    meet the following conditions:\n\n    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n        stating that You changed the files; and\n\n    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n        the Derivative Works; and\n\n    (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n        as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n    same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n    identification within third-party archives.\n\n Copyright (c) 2015-2017 Google, Inc., Netflix, Inc., Microsoft Corp. and contributors\n\n Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n limitations under the License."
