  license_text: "# clipboard.js\n\n[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/zenorocha/clipboard.js/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/zenorocha/clipboard.js)\n![Killing Flash](https://img.shields.io/badge/killing-flash-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)\n\n> Modern copy to clipboard. No Flash. Just 3kb gzipped.\n\n<a href=\"https://clipboardjs.com/\"><img width=\"728\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/16165747/a0f6fc46-349a-11e6-8c9b-c5fd58d9099c.png\" alt=\"Demo\"></a>\n\n## Why\n\nCopying text to the clipboard shouldn't be hard. It shouldn't require dozens of steps to configure or hundreds of KBs to load. But most of all, it shouldn't depend on Flash or any bloated framework.\n\nThat's why clipboard.js exists.\n\n## Install\n\nYou can get it on npm.\n\n```\nnpm install clipboard --save\n```\n\nOr bower, too.\n\n```\nbower install clipboard --save\n```\n\nIf you're not into package management, just [download a ZIP](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/archive/master.zip) file.\n\n## Setup\n\nFirst, include the script located on the `dist` folder or load it from [a third-party CDN provider](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/wiki/CDN-Providers).\n\n```html\n<script src=\"dist/clipboard.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nNow, you need to instantiate it by [passing a DOM selector](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/blob/master/demo/constructor-selector.html#L18), [HTML element](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/blob/master/demo/constructor-node.html#L16-L17), or [list of HTML elements](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/blob/master/demo/constructor-nodelist.html#L18-L19).\n\n```js\nnew Clipboard('.btn');\n```\n\nInternally, we need to fetch all elements that matches with your selector and attach event listeners for each one. But guess what? If you have hundreds of matches, this operation can consume a lot of memory.\n\nFor this reason we use [event delegation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1687296/what-is-dom-event-delegation) which replaces multiple event listeners with just a single listener. After all, [#perfmatters](https://twitter.com/hashtag/perfmatters).\n\n# Usage\n\nWe're living a _declarative renaissance_, that's why we decided to take advantage of [HTML5 data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes) for better usability.\n\n### Copy text from another element\n\nA pretty common use case is to copy content from another element. You can do that by adding a `data-clipboard-target` attribute in your trigger element.\n\nThe value you include on this attribute needs to match another's element selector.\n\n<a href=\"https://clipboardjs.com/#example-target\"><img width=\"473\" alt=\"example-2\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/9983467/a4946aaa-5fb1-11e5-9780-f09fcd7ca6c8.png\"></a>\n\n```html\n<!-- Target -->\n<input id=\"foo\" value=\"https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js.git\">\n\n<!-- Trigger -->\n<button class=\"btn\" data-clipboard-target=\"#foo\">\n    <img src=\"assets/clippy.svg\" alt=\"Copy to clipboard\">\n</button>\n```\n\n### Cut text from another element\n\nAdditionally, you can define a `data-clipboard-action` attribute to specify if you want to either `copy` or `cut` content.\n\nIf you omit this attribute, `copy` will be used by default.\n\n<a href=\"https://clipboardjs.com/#example-action\"><img width=\"473\" alt=\"example-3\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/10000358/7df57b9c-6050-11e5-9cd1-fbc51d2fd0a7.png\"></a>\n\n```html\n<!-- Target -->\n<textarea id=\"bar\">Mussum ipsum cacilds...</textarea>\n\n<!-- Trigger -->\n<button class=\"btn\" data-clipboard-action=\"cut\" data-clipboard-target=\"#bar\">\n    Cut to clipboard\n</button>\n```\n\nAs you may expect, the `cut` action only works on `<input>` or `<textarea>` elements.\n\n### Copy text from attribute\n\nTruth is, you don't even need another element to copy its content from. You can just include a `data-clipboard-text` attribute in your trigger element.\n\n<a href=\"https://clipboardjs.com/#example-text\"><img width=\"147\" alt=\"example-1\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/10000347/6e16cf8c-6050-11e5-9883-1c5681f9ec45.png\"></a>\n\n```html\n<!-- Trigger -->\n<button class=\"btn\" data-clipboard-text=\"Just because you can doesn't mean you should — clipboard.js\">\n    Copy to clipboard\n</button>\n```\n\n## Events\n\nThere are cases where you'd like to show some user feedback or capture what has been selected after a copy/cut operation.\n\nThat's why we fire custom events such as `success` and `error` for you to listen and implement your custom logic.\n\n```js\nvar clipboard = new Clipboard('.btn');\n\nclipboard.on('success', function(e) {\n    console.info('Action:', e.action);\n    console.info('Text:', e.text);\n    console.info('Trigger:', e.trigger);\n\n    e.clearSelection();\n});\n\nclipboard.on('error', function(e) {\n    console.error('Action:', e.action);\n    console.error('Trigger:', e.trigger);\n});\n```\n\nFor a live demonstration, open this [site](https://clipboardjs.com/) and just your console :)\n\n## Advanced Options\n\nIf you don't want to modify your HTML, there's a pretty handy imperative API for you to use. All you need to do is declare a function, do your thing, and return a value.\n\nFor instance, if you want to dynamically set a `target`, you'll need to return a Node.\n\n```js\nnew Clipboard('.btn', {\n    target: function(trigger) {\n        return trigger.nextElementSibling;\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIf you want to dynamically set a `text`, you'll return a String.\n\n```js\nnew Clipboard('.btn', {\n    text: function(trigger) {\n        return trigger.getAttribute('aria-label');\n    }\n});\n```\n\nAlso, if you are working with single page apps, you may want to manage the lifecycle of the DOM more precisely. Here's how you clean up the events and objects that we create.\n\n```js\nvar clipboard = new Clipboard('.btn');\nclipboard.destroy();\n```\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThis library relies on both [Selection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection) and [execCommand](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand) APIs. The first one is [supported by all browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=selection) while the second one is supported in the following browsers.\n\n| <img src=\"https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/chrome.png\" width=\"48px\" height=\"48px\" alt=\"Chrome logo\"> | <img src=\"https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/edge.png\" width=\"48px\" height=\"48px\" alt=\"Edge logo\"> | <img src=\"https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/firefox.png\" width=\"48px\" height=\"48px\" alt=\"Firefox logo\"> | <img src=\"https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/ie.png\" width=\"48px\" height=\"48px\" alt=\"Internet Explorer logo\"> | <img src=\"https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/opera.png\" width=\"48px\" height=\"48px\" alt=\"Opera logo\"> | <img src=\"https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/safari.png\" width=\"48px\" height=\"48px\" alt=\"Safari logo\"> |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| 42+ ✔ | 12+ ✔ | 41+ ✔ | 9+ ✔ | 29+ ✔ | 10+ ✔ |\n\nThe good news is that clipboard.js gracefully degrades if you need to support older browsers. All you have to do is show a tooltip saying `Copied!` when `success` event is called and `Press Ctrl+C to copy` when `error` event is called because the text is already selected.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](http://zenorocha.mit-license.org/) © Zeno Rocha"

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n 7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n    replaced with your own identifying information.
